# Meme Factory

After playing the Jackbox game "Job Job", we found it funny when random absurd motivational posters would appear. I thought I'd try my hand at it, then decided it'd be even funnier if we could use a LLM and image generation to make it even more random and absurd. It, obviously, expanded into memes.

This is not really for others to use or install as it involves a bunch of custom database tables with random words, memes, lyrics, etc to use in the generation which are not included, but I wanted it out here to help me deploy it to my webserver easier and also if anyone wants some of the code.
